@1177 = ~Would that your claim of innocence meant anything to the dead of Saradush.  Were I to question the recent dead of Athkatla, of Baldur's Gate, of Candlekeep...would I not find some who would claim such innocence for themselves?  Who died merely because they were caught in your wake?你敢說對史拉督許城的屠殺一點責任沒有麼﹐還有阿斯卡特拉﹐博得之門﹐燭堡的那些死者﹐沒有無辜的人麼﹖有多少只是因為打擾了你的休息而被殺的﹖~

@495 = ~Yes <PRO_SIRMAAM>!  (giggle!)  Time to kick a certain someone's butt, right?是的﹐<PRO_SIRMAAM>﹗（咯咯）~

@448 = ~Do not speak her name, dog.  Ellesime will understand the fullness of her regret soon enough.  As for you...Melissan has given me the opportunity to return an old favor.  One ascension for another...it rings with universal justice.你不配提她的名字﹐混蛋。艾麗星很快就會後悔之極了﹐至於你﹐梅麗珊給了我還你這個人情的機會﹐~

@278 = ~Yet I certainly would not have allowed <CHARNAME> to escape from me, had <PRO_HESHE> been within my power not once but twice, even.  But, then, I imagine you were too busy taking control of insane asylums and making thieves out of vampires for absolutely no reason.我當然不會讓<CHARNAME>從我的手心中再一次跑出去﹐但你現在也忙於處理那瘋狂的避難所﹐才導致吸血鬼栽在影賊手中。~
