现在的版本是简体版，如果使用的是繁体BG2，那请先把*.tra文件（可直接用记事本打开）里面的简体中文转换成繁体，否则安装的话会出现乱码。

这是翻译不太合适的地方，如果有了好的翻译方式，请给我来信kabalaka@sina.com
@1177 = ~Would that your claim of innocence meant anything to the dead of Saradush.  Were I to question the recent dead of Athkatla, of Baldur's Gate, of Candlekeep...would I not find some who would claim such innocence for themselves?  Who died merely because they were caught in your wake?你敢说对史拉督许城的屠杀一点责任没有么，还有阿斯卡特拉，博得之门，烛堡的那些死者，没有无辜的人么？有多少只是因为打扰了你的休息而被杀的？~

@495 = ~Yes <PRO_SIRMAAM>!  (giggle!)  Time to kick a certain someone's butt, right?是的，<PRO_SIRMAAM>！（咯咯）~

@448 = ~Do not speak her name, dog.  Ellesime will understand the fullness of her regret soon enough.  As for you...Melissan has given me the opportunity to return an old favor.  One ascension for another...it rings with universal justice.你不配提她的名字，混蛋。艾丽星很快就会后悔之极了，至于你，梅丽珊给了我还你这个人情的机会，~

@278 = ~Yet I certainly would not have allowed <CHARNAME> to escape from me, had <PRO_HESHE> been within my power not once but twice, even.  But, then, I imagine you were too busy taking control of insane asylums and making thieves out of vampires for absolutely no reason.我当然不会让<CHARNAME>从我的手心中再一次跑出去，但你现在也忙于处理那疯狂的避难所，才导致吸血鬼栽在影贼手中。~
