@435 = ~Indeed.  We meet once again.~
@436 = ~That's okay.  If Sarevok can turn up like a bad penny, then you're allowed to, as well.~
@437 = ~You told her how to influence me, didn't you?  And you told her I was in Suldanessalar.~
@438 = ~You're a pathetic excuse for an elf, Irenicus.  If you wish to die again, I'll happily oblige.~
@439 = ~You're collecting my leavings, Melissan?  How very sad for you.~
@440 = ~So, <CHARNAME>...it is now just you and I, once again.  At odds in the bowels of Hell and preparing to do combat.  How very fitting.~
@441 = ~This fight is mine, Irenicus.  While you stewed in Hell, my power has multiplied.~
@442 = ~You actually think you'll stop me?  It appears your delusions have survived the many beatings at my hand.~
@443 = ~So you're actually willing to serve as Melissan's little lackey?  I would expect more from the great elven magician.  Ellesime would be sad to see you reduced to this.~
@444 = ~Don't you ever tire of that bravado?  Haven't you received enough spankings upon my knee?~
@445 = ~You won't stop me, Irenicus.  Nobody can.  My destiny is at hand.~
@446 = ~It appears you have been the beneficiary of low expectations, but even I have learned from my mistakes.  Here, I have nothing to lose, not even my life.  Thanks to Melissan, I still have time to snuff out your divine ascencion personally. We will be even!~
@447 = ~You may have gained some crude and rudimentary control over your abilities in the interim, but even I have learned a thing or two... delusions or no.  And Melissan has given me the opportunity to personally see an end to your ascension... consider it a favor returned.~
@448 = ~Do not speak her name, dog.  Ellesime will understand the fullness of her regret soon enough.  As for you... Melissan has given me the opportunity to return an old favor.  One ascension for another... it rings with universal justice.~
@449 = ~How very glib and typical.  How far the expectations of the universe must have lowered to allow a gnat like you to even come this far.  It is fortunate that I have an opportunity, then, to repay your termination of my own ascension in kind.~
@450 = ~Ah, yes.  Familiar words.  Similar to the ones I spoke at the cusp of my own ascension.  How I would enjoy to repay that favor in kind and show the universe what an unworthy gnat you truly are.~
@451 = ~But enough of this.  Though I would dearly love to let my sister rot in her own Hell for eternity, it would not be a true and fitting re-union if I did not use my new power to send her an invitation.~
@452 = ~Do not overestimate your usefulness to me, 'dear' sister... nor the extent of my non-existent affection.  Or do you truly think I had forgotten your whispered urgings which had led me down the path of my exile?~
@453 = ~Enough, sister.  We do as Melissan bids, with her servants at our side.  Take delight, if you will, at the revenge we shall now taste.  Let us see, <CHARNAME>, if I can rip that soul out of you once more.  I would so delight in stealing your proud destiny a second time.~
@454 = ~You over-step your bounds, as always.  I did not call you here to rejoice in your venom, Bodhi.  Do you not notice where we are?  Whom we face?~
@455 = ~You think to betray me, Bodhi?  Foolish girl.  Melissan is the one who holds power here, and you hope to find succor at the feet of this fool <PRO_GIRLBOY>?  Stand by me or die with <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@456 = ~So my ungrateful sister, you finally stand by my side.  I shall deal with your treachery afterwards.  As for you,  <CHARNAME>, Mellisan has granted me the power to rip the divinity from your body.  The first thing I shall feel in an eon shall be pleasure as I watch your corpse turn to dust.~
@457 = ~I see.  So you leave me, sister, just as *she* left me.~
@458 = ~It is no matter.  Melissan has given me power enough, and her own servants shall teach you the error of your ways.  I shall strip the divinity from <CHARNAME>'s soul and you, *dear* sister, shall be nothing but dust beside <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@459 = ~Better that than a laughable fool whose most promising idea to dominate the Sword Coast was to 'poison' its supply of iron.  I discarded you as a candidate long before <CHARNAME> soundly defeated you merely for fear of losing all common sense merely by association with your pathetic soul.~
@460 = ~Bark if you wish, mongrel.  Whatever dull fangs you might have possessed have long since been pulled.  If a has-been wishes to ride <CHARNAME>'s coat-tails it makes no difference to me... but you'll be disintegrated right along with <PRO_HIMHER>.~
