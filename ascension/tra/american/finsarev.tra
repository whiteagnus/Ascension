@26  = ~Who--?  Melissan.  And <CHARNAME>, no less.  And to think that I had resigned myself to not being a part of this little play.  Who brought me here?  And why am I in my old armor?~
@27  = ~Fight <CHARNAME>?  Aye...I will do that.~
@28  = ~So you die again, as well.  It's all good.~
@29  = ~You're a fool, Sarevok, if you think you'll make any difference.~
@30  = ~You're willing to become Melissan's servant, now?  I'm disappointed.~
@31  = ~Then you'll die.  I gave you life again, and I can take it away...for the third time.~
@32  = ~It is true.  I may die again at your hand, <CHARNAME>.  But better that than sit in your shadow and taste the bile in my heart while you take what was once rightfully mine.  Better to fight for Melissan than suffer that.~
