2001 - Sept. - 09

*** These files are only intended for use for Baldur's Gate II with the Throne Of Bhaal expansion installed. They should not cause any conflicts or problems without it, but this cannot be guaranteed.

The files ABAZ2.BCS, ABAZ3.BCS, ABAZDG02.BCS, ABAZDG02.CRE, ABAZDG02.SPL, ABAZDRAG.BCS, ABAZIGAL.CRE, AR6005.ARE, AR6005.BCS, DRAGBLUE.CRE, DRAGBLUE.ITM, DRAGPUR1.ITM, DRAKE.ITM, DRAKE01.BCS, DRAKE01.CRE, DRAKE01.SPL, DRAKE02,BCS, DRAKE02.CRE, DRAKE02.SPL, DRAKE03.BCS, DRAKE03.CRE, DRAKE03.SPL, DRAKE04.BCS, DRAKE04.CRE, DRAKE04.SPL, DRAKRING.ITM, SLAGRICE.CRE and SPIN695.SPL contained in this archive are newly created and modified versions of Baldur's Gate II: Throne Of Bhaal area control scripts, an area definition file, AI scripts, creature definition files, creature "item" files and spell definition files relating to the battle with Abaziagal.

They have been provided by BioWare Senior Designer David Gaider as a supplement to the Throne Of Bhaal expansion. They increase the difficulty of the Abazigal battle, as was requested by players.

In David Gaider's words: "Some of the posters were recommending a multiple-dragon battle, so I added in some smaller drakes and a purple dragon into the Abazigal fight.  The AI has been tweaked heavily as well, blending in the mobility of Draconis (whom many thought was tougher than his father).  It's quite the fight, now...NOT for the faint of heart...but I'm told it's quite fun."

The update as of 2001-Sept.-09 from David Gaider slightly changes Abazigal's AI so that his Shockwave and Tail Slap effects won't go off during Time Stop.

To use:

Simply unzip all files contained in this archive other than this ReadMe into the Override folder inside your Baldur's Gate II folder, and quit/restart Baldur's Gate II: Throne Of Bhaal (if it's already running.)

Note: The AR6005.BCS and SPIN695.SPL files will already be present in your Baldur's Gate II Override folder with a default Throne Of Bhaal installation. If you wish to be able to restore this battle to its previous state, be sure to move or rename these two files so that they can be restored. Deletion of the files listed above and restoration of AR6005.BCS and SPIN695.SPL will uninstall this supplement.
