//COPY FILES - Hand of Murder Installation, original Ascension NOTE: For time's sake, the original effect was copied and namechanged to match references from the vanilla implementation of Hand of Murder, rather than patching the Hand of Murder spell headers to all use the original effect. Laziness, basically, but harmless laziness.
